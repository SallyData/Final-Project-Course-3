# Final-Project-Course-3
In this project, we have two data sets (training and test) and have to (i) merge these two data sets into one, and (ii) clean the data set. The code is written in R and can be find in the repository ("run_analysis" file). There is also a codebook ("Codebook" file) that explains the variables, code, and analysis.
